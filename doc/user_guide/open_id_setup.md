# OpenID Setup

A production installation of the MCP server may require proper security configuration.
This is certainly the case if the server is deployed as an HTTP server. Then its tools
must be protected with an authorisation mechanism. This section of the User Guide
provides details on how Exasol MCP server can be configured in the remote deployment
scenario, i.e., as an HTTP server.

The MCP supports and recommends OAuth2 as the authorization framework for protecting
the tools and resources from unauthorized access. OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are modern
and widely used specifications for resource protection. Exasol MCP server supports
OAuth2-based authorization to control access to its own tools, as well as the Exasol
database. The authentication options for the database connection are described in
the [Database Connection Setup](db_connection_setup.md) guide. This section focuses
on the configuration of the MCP Server authorization.

It is assumed that the reader has some familiarity with the basic concepts of OAuth2.
Without going into details on how OAuth2 works, let us recap what roles exist in
this specification and how they map onto MCP interaction.

The OAuth2 defines four actors:
- The resource with a certain API.
- The client, usually an application that wants to access the resource.
- The resource owner, usually a human, who can authorize the client to access the resource.
- The identity server, a service used to facilitate the authorization.

In the MCP case, the resource API is the server tools, and the client is the MCP client
application, e.g. Claude Desktop.

## OAuth in FastMCP

The implementation of Exasol MCP Server is based on FastMCP package, hence its
authentication layer is based on [FastMCP Authentication](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/authentication).
Exasol MCP Server supports all authentication mechanisms provided by FastMCP at the
moment of the release. However, the FastMCP authentication is currently in active
development.

### FastMCP Integration with Identity Providers

The FastMCP provides an integration with several popular OAuth providers.
At the time of writing, the following providers are supported:
- [Auth0](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/auth0)
- [AuthKit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/authkit)
- [AWS Cognito](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/aws-cognito)
- [Azure](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure)
- [Descope](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/descope)
- [GitHub](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github)
- [Scalekit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit)
- [Google](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/google)
- [WorkOS](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/workos)

To configure the MCP authentication with any of these providers, please set the
environment variables, as described in the FastMCP documentation for a particular
provider. As an example, the following environment variables shall be set when
working with AuthKit:
```bash
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos.AuthKitProvider
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AUTHKITPROVIDER_AUTHKIT_DOMAIN=https://your-project.authkit.app
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AUTHKITPROVIDER_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com
```
Note that the `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH` should always be set to the module path of the
provider's class.

### FastMCP Generic OAuth Providers

The FastMCP also provides three generic ways to configure the OAuth2 authentication.
- [Remote OAuth](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/remote-oauth), to work with identity
servers supporting Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).
- [OAuth Proxy](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oauth-proxy), to work with identity
servers that do not support DCR.
- [Token Verification](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification), for the
case when the MCP server only verifies a bearer token, not being concerned about how this
token is acquired.

If the chosen identity provider is not in the above list, it should still be possible to
configure the MCP server authentication using one of those generic providers. Please use
[Remote OAuth](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/remote-oauth) if the provider supports
DCR, and [OAuth Proxy](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) if it doesn't.

Currently, FastMCP does not define environment variables for generic providers. Exasol
MCP Server fills the gap by providing its own set of variables in a similar fashion.
As with specific providers, the variable `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH` should be set to the path
of the chosen generic auth provider class. The required value for this variable can be
found in one of the tables below.

Normally, two sets of variables must be configured - one for a Token Verifier and another
one for the provider - Remote OAuth or OAuth Proxy.

The tables below list all possible variables in each set. Note that the column `Required`
means whether the value is mandatory or not in the corresponding FastMCP module. An
optional (for FastMCP) variable may be required by a particular identity provider. One
need to check the provider's specification to find out what information should be supplied.

The rest of this section provides information about the environment variables defined by
Exasol MCP Server.

### Token Verification

Both `Remote OAuth` and `OAuthProxy` require a [Token Verifier](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification).
The choice of the token verifier depends on the token verification model supported by a
particular identity provider.

At the time of writing, the latest release of the FastMCP - 2.12.5 - only offers the
JWT Token Verification. The Opaque Token Verification should be added soon.

A token verifier provider may be the only module needed if the MCP Authentication uses
an externally supplied bearer token. However, this guide doesn't give any details on how
such a system could be configured. Also, in this scenario, we recommend using FastMCP's
[environment variables](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification), not the Exasol ones.
